		<h2>Pusheen cat</h2>
		<p>Pusheen is a cartoon cat who is the subject of comic strips, plush toys, vinyl figures, sticker sets, and more, on Tumblr, Facebook, Instagram, iMessage, YouTube, and other social media platforms. Pusheen was created in 2010 by Claire Belton and Andrew Duff for a comic strip on their website, Everyday Cute. More recently, the Pusheen character has been used in social media posts, and on the Pusheen blog.</p>

		<aside>
			<p>On the official Pusheen website (Pusheen.com), Pusheen is described as being a female fictional cat who loves blogging, snacking, and going on adventures. The original comic strip series included characters modeled after Belton, Duff, their dog named Carm (short for "Carmen"), and Pusheen, a chubby grey tabby cat based on Belton's cat that now lives with her parents in Oregon, Illinois. Pusheen's name stems from the word puis√≠n, which means kitten in Irish.</p>
